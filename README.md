Welcome to the File Zipper with Huffman Coding project! This repository houses an efficient and elegant solution for file compression, utilizing the power of the Huffman coding algorithm. Huffman coding is a widely recognized technique for lossless data compression, and our implementation brings this powerful method into a practical tool that can significantly reduce the size of your files.
How It Works
Huffman coding is an ingenious algorithm that creates a variable-length code for each character based on its frequency of occurrence in the file. Characters that occur more frequently are assigned shorter codes, while those that occur less frequently are assigned longer codes. This results in a highly efficient representation of the data, significantly reducing file size.

The process involves:

Building a Frequency Table: Analyzing the input file to count the frequency of each character.
Constructing the Huffman Tree: Creating a binary tree where each leaf node represents a character and its frequency.
Generating Codes: Traversing the tree to generate unique binary codes for each character.
Encoding the File: Replacing each character in the input file with its corresponding binary code.
Decoding the File: Using the Huffman tree to decode the binary codes back into the original characters.

Performance
The File Zipper with Huffman Coding is designed to handle a wide range of file sizes and types, delivering impressive compression ratios while maintaining fast processing speeds. It is an ideal tool for anyone needing to store or transfer large files more efficiently.
